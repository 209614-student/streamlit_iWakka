## iWakka therapy evaluation app

The purpose of this work is to prepare software for data analysis and results comparison for iWakka hand therapy.
The iWakka device is intended for training the control of the grip strength of a hand at specific time trajectories. 
Me and my friends from University tested this device in hospital. During this research I was using Python script to evaluate progress of iWakka therapy.

This project is the next step for easier assessment of patient indicators, remotely, their statistical analysis and visualization. It can also be used to diagnose the condition of a trainee.
This is prototype software for evaluation results from the actual use of the iWakka device.
